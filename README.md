# Real Estate Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Description
This project predicts real estate prices based on various property features using **Machine Learning**. The model is trained on real estate data from **Bangalore**, and it uses a **Linear Regression** algorithm to make price predictions. The web application is built using **Flask** for the backend and **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the frontend.

## 📊 How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset contains property details like location, size, price, etc.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing the data for better accuracy.
3. **Model Training**: A **Linear Regression Model** is trained on the dataset.
4. **Web Interface**: Users can enter property details on a web page and get a predicted price.
